Use this template to create "Guides" and similar documentation. It's structured
like a Guides guide, and it walks you through the process of creating and
publishing a document. It uses [Jekyll][] as the rendering system, and the
[`{{site.theme}}`][theme-gem] Ruby gem for the theme.

[Jekyll]:    https://jekyllrb.com/
[theme-gem]: https://rubygems.org/gems/{{site.theme}}

### Create a new guide/document

To get started on a new guide (or other document based on this theme), follow
[the "Getting started" instructions in the mbland/guides-template GitHub
repository][mbland-gt] to create a local clone of this template.

[mbland-gt]: https://github.com/mbland/guides-template/#getting-started

Once you've created a clone, click the _Add a new page_ entry in the table of
contents to begin the rest of the steps.
